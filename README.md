# Challenge Logiin
**- Create a simple webapp in "Master Detail" format that shows a list of items. Angular and Bootstrap should be used. We should be able to edit any item from the list.** 
*Bonus:* I also made a full CRUD system where you can also create and delete any item.

In this project, Angular 10 was used with Bootstrap 8. Angular 11 is already available but still has some compatibility issues with Bootstrap (and TailwindCSS) components.

How to test this project:
Make sure you have NPM installed.
Clone this repo, cd into it and then do:

    $ npm install && npm start

Or build it in *"production mode"* with:

    $ npm install && npx @angular/cli@10 build --prod
